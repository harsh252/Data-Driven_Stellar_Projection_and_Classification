# Data-Driven Stellar Classification Repository

## Description

Welcome to the Data-Driven Stellar Classification repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible approach to classifying stars based on their observational data using advanced data-driven techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

Stellar classification plays a crucial role in understanding the properties and evolution of stars. Traditionally, astronomers have used spectral characteristics and manual categorization to classify stars into different spectral types, luminosity classes, and subclasses. However, with the exponential growth of astronomical data, data-driven methods have emerged as powerful tools to enhance and automate the classification process.

## Key Features

1. **High-Quality Datasets:** We have curated and compiled diverse datasets containing a large collection of stellar spectra, photometric measurements, and other relevant features from various space missions and ground-based observatories.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering:** The repository includes robust data preprocessing scripts to clean, normalize, and augment the raw data, as well as feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful information from the raw measurements.

3. **Machine Learning Models:** We have implemented state-of-the-art machine learning models for stellar classification, such as Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, and more. These models are designed to leverage the power of data-driven techniques and automatically learn patterns from the input data.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** The repository provides code for training the models on the prepared datasets and evaluating their performance using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

5. **Hyperparameter Optimization:** To fine-tune the models effectively, we have incorporated hyperparameter optimization techniques, enabling users to get the best possible results for their specific datasets.

6. **Ensemble Voting Classifier:** In addition to the existing models, we have introduced a new Ensemble Voting Classifier that combines the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final classification.

7. **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks:** Interactive Jupyter notebooks are available, demonstrating step-by-step tutorials on data preprocessing, model training, and result analysis, making it easier for both beginners and experienced researchers to follow along.

8. **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation and guidelines are provided to assist users in understanding the repository's structure, functionality, and how to contribute to the project.
